## Crap is the pinnacle of c++

As the creator of Git and Linux himself
[prophezised](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus) a crap versioning
system written in c++ was destined to come to into existence. Therefore crap
is implemented in only pure c++.


## Example crap workflow

1. Create some folder with data that you want to version control

```

mkdir test-project
cd test-project
echo hello > text.txt

```


2. Init a potty to store your preacious content

```
crap init
```

3. Dump your newly created content into the potty

```
crap dump text.txt
```

4. Look at the content of the potty to verify you managed to dump everything

```
crap look
```

5. Flush the content of the potty to the tank

```
crap flush
```

6. Rinse and repeat



So what are you waiting for? Convert your projects to crap today!
